eHoshin
=======

**eHoshin** is a one page web application aiming to help companies to improve/start their own hoshin process. eHoshin helps you by allowing your employees to participate to that process in an easy manner and to have a clear overall vision (this last part is still in development).

This is an open source version aiming to adapt the application to your own process and to set you own security systems (users authentication, databases...). If you don't need to do that or just want to try the system without effort, you can use the [common web site](https://commonehoshin.herokuapp.com/). It's a running eHoshin web site with multiple team spaces. Just create a user, your own team and invite some co-worker to try it.

## Installing

The master branch currently contains the last release of the web site.
